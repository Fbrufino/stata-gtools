## gtools-0.2.0 (2017-05-19)

### Features

* `gcollapse` `smart` option indexes thye data based on the sorted groups
  so no hashing and sorting is necessary. It no longer calls `collapse`,
  which is slower.
* `gcollapse` provides `merge` to merge the collapsed data back with the
  original data. This is much fastere than collapsing and then merging.
* `gcollapse` provides `multi` to invoke the multi-threaded version of
  the collapse routine.
* Computing percentiles is less inefficient, but it is still inefficient.
  When this is particularly slow, the `multi` option can compensate.
* The code base is cleaner and the C code is (mostly) commented.

### Problems

* Only available when `c(os)` is Unix.
* Memory management is terrible. See previous notes or `README.md`
  section on memory management.
* Not provided
    * semean
    * sebinomial
    * sepoisson
    * rawsum

### Planned

* `checkmem` feature to call `fcollapse` or `collapse` when the plugin
  suspects there will not be enough memory.
* `gegen` as a drop-in replacement for `egen` that should be faster than
  `fegen` and also implementes `egenmore`.
* Improve memory management.

## gtools-0.1.0 (2017-05-16)

### Features

* `gcollapse` provides a C-based near-drop-in replacement for `collapse`
  that is (almost always) several times faster than `fcollapse`.
* Though computing percentiles is currently very inefficient (see below),
  `gcollapse`, unlike `collapse` (of `fcollapse` as best I can tell) can
  compute quantiles, not just percentiles (e.g. p2.5, p15.25)

### Problems

* Only available `c(os)` is Unix.
* Quantile implementation is massively inefficient (via C's `qsort`). In
  fact, it it possible that `fcollapse` will be ~50% faster if there are
  many levels/sgroups (hundreds of thousands or millions) and more than
  a few percentiles (3 or more).
* Memory management is terrible. `fcollapse` does not consume too much
  more memory than collapse because mata can add and drop variables at
  requisite times. C, on the other hand, cannot add or drop variables
  in Stata, and target variables must already exit. This means that for
  every additional summary variable (i.e. 2 or more) based on a single
  source variable, Stata must create them before collapsing the data.
  Thus it is possible that systems that run `collapse` or `fcollapse`
  with ease are not able to run `gcollapse` due to the additional
  memory overhead. See the memory management section in `README.md` to
  estimate whether your system will be able to take advantage of the
  speed improvements of `gcollapse` if you are concerned about memory
  management.
* Not provided
    * semean
    * sebinomial
    * sepoisson
    * rawsum

### Planned

* `gegen` as a drop-in replacement for `egen` that should be faster than
  `fegen` and also implementes `egenmore`.
* Improve quantile implementation (perhaps using a better implementation
  of `quickselect`; my attempt at implementing quickselect was slowe
  than `qsort`).
* Improve memory management.
