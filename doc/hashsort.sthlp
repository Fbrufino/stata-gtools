{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt hashsort} uses C-plugins to implement a hash-based sort that is always
faster than {opt sort} for sorting groups and faster than {opt gsort} in
general. {opt hashsort} hashes the data and sorts the hash, and then it sorts
one observation per group. The fewer the number of gorups relative to the
number of observations, the larger the speed gain.

{pstd}
If the sort is expected to be unique or if the number of groups is large, then
this comes at a potentially large memory penalty and it may not be faster than
{opt sort} (the exception is when the sorting variables are all integers).

{pstd}
Each {varname} can be numeric or a string. The observations are placed in
ascending order of {it:varname} if {opt +} or nothing is typed in front of the
name and are placed in descending order if {opt -} is typed. {opt hashsort}
always produces a stable sort.
