gquantiles_switch_sanity (many duplicates)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Testing whether gquantiles method switch code is sane for quantiles.
The table shows the actual ratio between method 1 and method 2 vs the
ratio used to decide between the two. Method 2 is chosen if the ratio
in parenthesis is > 1, and method 1 is chosen otherwise.

    - Good choice: Both are larger than 1 or less than 1.
    - OK choice: Actual ratio is close to 1 and decision ratio was off.
    - Poor choice: Actual ratio is far from 1 and decision ratio was off.

    - Good choice: Both are larger than 1 or less than 1.
    - OK choice: Actual ratio is close to 1 and decision ratio was off.
    - Poor choice: Actual ratio is far from 1 and decision ratio was off.

I think 'far from one' is a deviation of 0.2 or more.
